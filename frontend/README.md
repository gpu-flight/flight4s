# Kernel Annotation Prototype

This optional Scala 3.8.1 module implements `flight4s.frontend.kernel` using
Scala's experimental `MacroAnnotation` API. It annotates an existing typed
kernel factory and rewrites top-level `Expr[T]` vals to `CudaDsl.let` snapshots.

## Public Contract

```scala
import scala.annotation.experimental
import flight4s.frontend.kernel
import flight4s.core.dsl.CudaDsl.{kernel as buildKernel, *}

@experimental
@kernel
def vectorAdd = buildKernel("vectorAdd", params(
    input[Float]("left"), input[Float]("right"),
    output[Float]("target"), value[Int]("count"))) { p =>
  val i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x
  when(i < p._4) {
    p._3(i) := p._1(i).read + p._2(i).read
  }
}
```

The factory's existing method and `Kernel[Args]` return type remain visible in
separately compiled Scala source. No generated sibling method is required.
Factories are concrete, non-inline, have no type/value/context parameters,
and directly call `CudaDsl.kernel` with a literal body lambda. An empty `()`
parameter list is allowed. Kernel names and typed signatures stay explicit.
`input`/`output` are the canonical spellings; their short aliases are available
in the explicit DSL. Output buffers are read-write, not write-only.

A separately compiled caller retains the exact launch argument types:

```scala
import scala.annotation.experimental
import flight4s.core.ir.{DeviceBuffer, Kernel}

@experimental
def definition: Kernel[(DeviceBuffer[Float], DeviceBuffer[Float], DeviceBuffer[Float], Int)] =
  vectorAdd
```

Both definition and caller explicitly opt in. Scala's `-experimental` flag
marks all top-level definitions experimental and propagates to consumers;
the project does not enable that flag. The stable core/runtime/examples use
their existing compiler settings. Development tests enable `-Xcheck-macros`
and `-Ycheck:all`, including actual separate compiler invocations.

## Snapshot Semantics

Inside the direct kernel body:

```scala
val original = data(i).read
data(i) := literal(9)
target(i) := original
```

The annotation inserts the equivalent of `let(data(i).read)` at the val
declaration. The later use reads the saved device value. The initializer
constructs its expression once, and the original val's Scala source span is
retained. Each factory invocation builds a fresh kernel with automatic local
binding identities; generated CUDA names remain deterministic.

Explicit `let` vals are preserved without an extra snapshot. In nested DSL
branches and callbacks, use explicit `let` where statement effects are allowed.
Expression-only callbacks still enforce the core's staging restrictions.

## Supported Subset

- Top-level immutable bindings with exactly the public `Expr[T]` type.
- Literal host constants and existing non-Expr core DSL binding objects as metadata.
- Existing DSL operations, typed buffer access, arithmetic and explicit
  `when`/`gpuIf` control flow, subject to existing IR validation.
- The complete existing CUDA C++ -> NVRTC/PTX -> typed launch pipeline.

The prototype rejects Scala `var`, `lazy val`, ordinary control flow/assignment,
implicit Expr vals in nested bodies, arbitrary host/helper calls (including
parameterless methods), captured mutable host state, captured external Expr
values, tuple/product snapshot bindings, and concrete IR-node subtype vals.
The restriction is a documented compiler subset, not a security sandbox.
The method's signature and kernel name are normal host-side DSL construction.

The annotation runs after Scala type checking. It cannot make ordinary
`if (Expr[Boolean])` type-check. A Unit-returning CUDA-looking method with typed
parameters, automatic signature inference, nested snapshots, mutable state,
and ordinary device control flow remain future frontend work.

## Verification

From the repository root, with the JNI library built:

```powershell
java "-Dsbt.supershell=false" "-Dflight4s.cuda.native.path=C:\Users\myoun\Documents\sources\gpuflight\flight4s\native\build\Release\flight4s_cuda.dll" -jar C:\Users\myoun\AppData\Local\Temp\sbt-launch-1.12.2.jar "frontendTests/test"
```

`KernelAnnotationSuite` compiles definition/use programs separately, checks
opt-in and typed argument admission, and runs negative programs through actual
compiler phases. `AnnotationIrSuite` compares exact IR, effects, validation,
generated artifacts, deterministic names, and source mapping. Three GPU tests
run vector addition and Int/Float snapshot-after-write cases through NVRTC on
both default and explicit streams, including bounds, sentinels, and input
preservation. Without the native property, GPU fixtures skip.

The compiler harness depends on the pinned compiler only in the non-published
test project. The published frontend depends on the stable core.
